Source: https://github.com/saif-samy/Android_Messaging_App

Status: app is working but no notifications are sent or received (missing permission handling ?)

## dependencies:

```plaintext
https://github.com/intuit/sdp : An android lib that provides a new size unit - sdp (scalable dp). This size unit scales with the screen size. It can help Android developers with supporting multiple screens
https://github.com/intuit/ssp : An android lib that provides a new size unit - ssp (scalable sp). This size unit scales with the screen size based on the sp size unit (for texts). It can help Android developers with supporting multiple screens.
https://github.com/vinc3m1/RoundedImageView : RoundedImageView was originally made with a primary goal of memory and rendering performance, and specifically only worked well on Bitmaps. It had some very poorly performing hacks built in for non-bitmaps, along with a lot of hard to maintain synchronization of ScaleTypes and sizing between the ImageView and the Drawable itself.
  Note: [ARCHIVED] RoundedImageView is no longer actively maintained as there are better alternatives available
